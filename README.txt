Site was hosted using Amazon Web Services and deployed with Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Front-end design was written in javascript, html, and css. Back-end was written in python with flask web framework. MySql was used to access database.

The following API's were used for our web application: 
click,
Flask,
Flask-SQLAlchemy,
itsdangerous,
Jinja2,
MarkupSafe,
PyMySQL,
SQLAlchemy,
Werkzeug,
wheel,
Google Charts API

Limitations: Political data was hard to gather and was found in very limited amounts. Even though we made due with the limited information we were able to gather, our techniques and database would have benifited greatly from a data set with thousands of tuples such as the TripAdvisor Database. We were able to compensate for this by comparing and compiling together a plethora of smaller data sets and this is how we got our analysis.
