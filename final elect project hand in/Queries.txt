1. This query relates our VEP table and demographics table by joining on year and displaying the information.
select v.year, turnout, white, black, hispanic, other from vep v join demographics d on v.year = d.year

2. This query shows all tuples in gdp where year is greater than 1987 so that it correlates nicely with our other data.
select * from gdp where year > 1987

3. This query takes our educationperyear table which education levels for every year and joins it with the year's that were election years thus only displaying education levels for election years.
select e.year, e.lessthanHS, e.HS, e.college, e.postgrad from educationperyear e join President p on e.year = (p.YearBegin-1) order by p.YearBegin asc

4. This query prints out the relation between state income vs political affiliation of the state.
select * from state

5. This query serves to populate our condensed graph by joining all voter information tables on matching years.
select v.year, v.turnout, d.white, d.black, d.hispanic, d.other, g.income, e.lessthanHS, e.HS, e.college, e.postgrad from gdp g join vep v join demographics d join educationperyear e on (g.year = v.year) and (v.year = d.year) and (d.year = e.year)

6. This query has two dynamic inputs selection1 and selection 2 and its purpose is to join all of the election information tables and find the differences between the two elections.
select  (t1.turnout-t2.turnout) as turnoutDiff, (t1.white-t2.white) as whiteDiff, (t1.black-t2.black) as blackDiff, (t1.hispanic-t2.hispanic) as hispanicDiff, (t1.other-t2.other) as otherDiff, (t1.income-t2.income) as incomeDiff from (select v.year, v.turnout, white, black, hispanic, other, income from vep v join demographics d join gdp g on v.year = d.year and g.year = v.year) t1 join (select v.year, v.turnout, white, black, hispanic, other, income from vep v join demographics d join gdp g on v.year = d.year and g.year = v.year) t2 where t1.year = :selection1 and t2.year = :selection2


7. This query takes inputs year and thresholds and finds all elections within the given thresholds. 
select final2.year,final2.turnout, final2.white, final2.black, final2.hispanic, final2.other, final2.income, final1.name, final1.party, final1.SenateParty, final1.HouseParty from (select YearBegin-1 as year, p1.name, p2.party, SenateParty, HouseParty from President p1 join pmember p2 join controls c1 on p1.YearBegin-1 = c1.Year +1 and p1.name = p2.name) final1 join (select t2.year, t2.turnout,t2.white, t2.black, t2.hispanic, t2.other, t2.income from (select v.year, v.turnout, white, black, hispanic, other, income from vep v join demographics d join gdp g on v.year = d.year and g.year = v.year) t1 join (select v.year, v.turnout, white, black, hispanic, other, income from vep v join demographics d join gdp g on v.year = d.year and g.year = v.year) t2 where (t1.year = :year) and (abs(t1.turnout - t2.turnout) <= :vep and abs(t1.white - t2.white) <= :white and abs(t1.hispanic - t2.hispanic) <= :hispanic and abs(t1.black - t2.black) <= :black and abs(t1.other - t2.other) <= :other and abs(t1.income - t2.income) <= :gdp) order by abs(t1.turnout - t2.turnout) asc) final2 on final1.year = final2.year


8. This query takes two inputs house and senate and looks up tuples of which presidents won their election given the two combinations of Senate and House Of Representatives by joining three tables.
select (c2.YearBegin-1) as election_year, c2.name, c2.party, c1.SenateParty, c1.HouseParty from controls c1 join (select p1.name, p2.party, p1.YearBegin from President p1 join pmember p2 on p1.name = p2.name) c2 on (c1.HouseParty = :house) and (c1.SenateParty = :senate) and (c2.YearBegin-1 = (c1.year + 1))
